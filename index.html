            <p>Climate Change isn't arriving, it's <i> here</i>.</p>
            <p>We all know it, we all feel it: the snowfall is never as heavy anymore, heatwaves are unbearable, and we hear of more and more spontaneous fires every year.</p>
            <p>But is that all?</p>
            <p>If we can feel the effects of climate change so bluntly in the UK and its allied states, what of the countries we <i> don't</i> think about?</p> 
            <p>What about Palestine, Congo, Pakistan, and more? What about the bulldozed olive trees,  floods, and enslavement of indigenous populations so that the wealthy foreigner can make use of their natural resources? These countries, which historically contribute the least to global fossil fuel emissions but suffer the most severe consequences?</p>
            <p>Could it be that awareness of these issues isn't on the forefront of our minds for a reason? Is Colonialism, a concept we are told is long extinct, churning just the same as it did in the 15th century?</p>
            <p>Here, we narrow down on this reason, explore the root of our ignorance, and work to grow awareness.</p>
            <p>We can't promise an individual solution to these questions, but that isn't our goal either. By exploring our website, become aware of the impact of 21st century Colonialism on your life and the lives of your fellow human beings. Join us, and change the world, one tiny, human step at a time. </p>
